# Face_Attendance

## Overview
This project is a Face Attendance System designed to automate the process of taking attendance using facial recognition technology. The system captures images from a webcam, detects faces, matches them with known faces, and retrieves student information from Firebase Realtime Database to update attendance records.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Utilizes the face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces in captured frames.
- **Firebase Integration**: Retrieves student information such as name, branch, total attendance, standing, year, and starting year from Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Displays student information overlaid on the captured frames for easy attendance tracking.
- **Multiple Modes**: Supports different modes (e.g., loading screen) with corresponding background images for a visually pleasing user experience.
